# AI-Driven Supply Chain Analytics & Optimization

##  Project Summary

This project analyzes a sample **supply chain dataset** from SanDisk, applying:

- **Excel analysis** for forecasting, inventory risk, and supplier evaluation
- **Power BI dashboards** for interactive supply chain insights
- **Machine learning in Python** for demand forecasting, shortage prediction, and supplier risk classification

The goal is to improve **forecast accuracy, inventory management, and supply continuity**, directly aligning with roles in:

- Supply Chain Analytics
- Operations Research
- Data Science in Manufacturing
- Business Intelligence
- Process Optimization


##  Tools & Methods

- Excel (Pivot Tables, formulas for cost/risk analysis)
- Power BI (KPI dashboards, charts, interactivity)
- Python:
  - Pandas, NumPy – data handling
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn – visualizations
  - Scikit-learn, XGBoost – machine learning models
- Forecast Accuracy Metrics (MAPE, RMSE)
- Risk assessment methods for supplier and inventory evaluation
